## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="HeadShot.jpg">

Hi! I am a mechanical engineer interested in energy efficiency and energy analysis of alternative sources.

I recently graduated with an M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Sustainable Energy. 
In Toronto, I was introduced to the world of data analytics and machine learning and am interested in seeing how it can be applied to the energy industry. 

## Academic Projects

Smart City Challenge,[slides] ("bike_theft_presentation.ppt"), 2018
•	Coordinated with team members to statistically analyze bike theft data based on time and location to help allocate resources to theft-prone neighborhoods 
•	Individually implemented statistical models like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or DBSCAN in Python using various libraries (GeoPandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, SciPy, etc.)
•	Organized data based on time of day and seasons to generate a map of Toronto representing geospatial theft patterns
