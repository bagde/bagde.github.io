## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="HeadShot.jpg">

Hi! I am a mechanical engineer interested in energy efficiency and energy analysis of alternative sources.

I recently graduated with an M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Sustainable Energy. 
In Toronto, I was introduced to the world of data analytics and machine learning and am interested in seeing how it can be applied to the energy industry. 

Stay tuned as I update my website! 

## Academic Projects

**Bicycle Theft in Toronto**, Smart City Challenge, slides
Sep. 2018 – Dec. 2018
* Coordinated with team members to statistically analyze bike theft data based on time and location to help allocate resources to theft-prone neighborhoods 
* Individually implemented statistical models like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or DBSCAN in Python using various libraries (GeoPandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, etc.)
* Organized data based on time of day and seasons to generate a map of Toronto representing geospatial theft patterns  

**Energy Audit**, Shay's Kitchen, slides
Sep. 2018 – Dec. 2018
* Assessed the facility’s architectural layout and compiled past utility bills to create a site-specific energy consumption model on Excel
* Performed calculations of the facilities heat gain/loss to assess the efficiency of the current HVAC system in place
* Identified energy and water-saving opportunities and suggested cost-optimal solutions that yielded approximately $9,200 a year in energy savings

## Engineering Work Experience 

**Designer, Microfluidic lab-on-chip**, [iSSELab](https://www.isselab.com/research)
Sep. 2015 – Aug. 2016
* Developed 3D models of micro-chips and characterized the flow pattern for passive separation of blood particles 
* Developed a novel fabrication procedure of microchips that is convenient and cost effective 
* Tested prototypes to identify performance limits and improved the design for better results by analyzing test data
* Created clear and concise technical documents such as standard operating procedures, literature reviews, reports and presentations

## Other Work Experience

**Data Integrity Administrator**, [NOVA Chemicals](https://www.novachem.com/) 
Oct. 2019 – Current 
* Initiated collection of data to be able to implement data-driven solutions in increasing workflow process efficiency across the document control department 
* Managed individual responsibility of conducting quality assurance checks on 50+ documents daily for prompt turnaround of projects
* Communicated deficiencies with clients (orally or through written work) daily to resolve conflicts with project turnarounds

**Tutor**, [Prepatorium](https://www.prepatorium.com/)
Mar. 2019 – Aug. 2019
* Tutored high school students in science, algebra or calculus by identifying learners’ needs and resolving doubts promptly  
* Instructed at a weekly after-school program consisting of 5 primary school students to help them develop fundamental math and reading skills

**Teaching Assistant**, University of Toronto
Jan. 2019 – Apr. 2019
* Provided a class of 60+ students with guidance and technical support on course material covering key trends in the renewable and non-renewable energy industry 
* Graded assignments and exams by applying background knowledge of fluid flow, thermodynamics and heat transfer analyses 
* Proctored tests and exams to maintain a fair testing environment for all and provide any immediate assistance in lieu of the instructor
