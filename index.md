## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="HeadShot.jpg">

Hi! I am a mechanical engineer interested in energy efficiency and energy analysis of alternative sources.

I recently graduated with an M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Sustainable Energy. 
In Toronto, I was introduced to the world of data analytics and machine learning and am interested in seeing how it can be applied to the energy industry. 

## Academic Projects

**Bicycle Theft in Toronto**
Smart City Challenge, slides, 2018
* Coordinated with team members to statistically analyze bike theft data based on time and location to help allocate resources to theft-prone neighborhoods 
* Individually implemented statistical models like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or DBSCAN in Python using various libraries (GeoPandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, SciPy, etc.)
* Organized data based on time of day and seasons to generate a map of Toronto representing geospatial theft patterns  

**Energy Audit**
Shay's Kitchen, slides, 2018
* Assessed the facilityâ€™s architectural layout and compiled past utility bills to create a site-specific energy consumption model on Excel
* Performed calculations of the facilities heat gain/loss to assess the efficiency of the current HVAC system in place
* Identified energy and water-saving opportunities and suggested cost-optimal solutions that yielded approximately $9,200 a year in energy savings

## Engineering Work Experience 

**Designer, Microfluidic lab-on-chip **
[iSSELab](https://www.isselab.com/research), University of Alberta
* Developed 3D models of micro-chips and characterized the flow pattern for passive separation of blood particles 
* Developed a novel fabrication procedure of microchips that is convenient and cost effective 
* Tested prototypes to identify performance limits and improved the design for better results by analyzing test data
* Created clear and concise technical documents such as standard operating procedures, literature reviews, reports and presentations
