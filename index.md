## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="HeadShot.jpg">

Hi! I am a mechanical engineer interested in energy efficiency and energy analysis of alternative sources.

I recently graduated with an M.Eng in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Sustainable Energy. 
In Toronto, I was introduced to the world of data analytics and machine learning and am interested in seeing how it can be applied to the energy industry.
